  <h1> The Best animal,Cats! </h1> <br>
                                      
   <p> The “cat pattern,” established very early in the evolution of modern mammals, was a successful one: early cats were already typical in form at a time when the ancestors of most other modern mammalian types were scarcely recognizable.<br> They first appeared in the early Pliocene Epoch (5.3 to 3.6 million years ago), and they have continued with remarkably little change into modern times. <br>
  Cats have long been known to other cultures. Wall tiles in Crete dating from 1600 BCE depict hunting cats. Evidence from art and literature indicates that the cat was present in Greece from the 5th century BCE, and tiles featuring cats appeared in China from 500 BCE. In India cats were mentioned in Sanskrit writings around 100 BCE, while the Arabs and the Japanese were not introduced to the cat until about 600 CE.<br>
Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don’t taste sweetness.<br>
                                     
A cat with a question-mark-shaped tail is asking, “Want to play?”<br>
According to Wilde, a slow blink is a “kitty kiss.” This movement shows contentment and trust.<br>
Cats have a unique “vocabulary” with their owner — each cat has a different set of vocalizations, purrs and behaviors.<br>
Cats have up to 100 different vocalizations — dogs only have 10.<br>
Cats find it threatening when you make direct eye contact with them.<br>
Cats mark you as their territory<br>
when they rub their faces and bodies against you, as they have scent glands in those areas.<br>

Cats may yawn as a way to end a confrontation with another animal. Think of it as their “talk to the hand” gesture.<br>
Hissing is defensive, not aggressive, says Wilde. “It’s an expression of fear, stress or discomfort of a threatened cat communicating ‘stay away,'” she says.<br>
If cats are fighting, the cat that’s hissing is the more vulnerable one, says Wilde.<br>
If your cat approaches you with a straight, almost vibrating tail, this means that she is extremely happy to see you.<br>
Kneading — which some people refer to as “making biscuits” — is a sign of contentment and happiness. Cats knead their mothers when they are nursing to stimulate the let-down of milk.<br>
Meowing is a behavior that cats developed exclusively to communicate with people.<br>
When a cat flops over and exposes his belly, it’s not always an invitation for a belly rub. A cat does this when he’s relaxed and showing trust.<br>
When cats hit you with retracted claws, they’re playing, not attacking.<br>
When dogs wag their tails, they may be expressing happiness. But this isn’t the case for cats! When your cat wags her tail, it’s her way of warning you that you are getting on her last nerve.<br>
When your cat sticks his butt in your face, he is doing so as a gesture of friendship.<br>
Whiskers are also good indicators of a cat’s mood. When a cat is scared, he put his whiskers back. But when a cat is in hunting mode, he puts his whiskers forward.<br>
Your cat drapes its tail over another cat, your dog, or you as a symbol of friendship.<br>


Cats are very fussy about their water bowls; some prefer to ignore their bowls entirely in favor of drinking from the sink faucet.<br>
Cats groom other cats — and sometimes people — in a ritual called allogrooming.<br>
Cats like to sleep on things that smell like their owners, such as their pillows and dirty laundry (ick!).<br>
Cats love to sleep in laundry baskets, too, because they’re basically hiding places with peep holes.<br> <p>

<p>Cats often attack your ankles when they’re bored.<br>
Certain cats go crazy for foods you wouldn’t expect, like olives, potato chips, and the hops in beer.<br>
For some reason, cats really dislike citrus scents.<br>
If you can’t find your cat, you should look in a box or a bag, as these are some of their favorite hiding spots!<br>
Male cats who try to get to a female in heat can show very bizarre behavior — for example, some have been known to slide down chimneys!<br>
Many cats like to lick their owner’s freshly washed hair.<br>
Some cats love the smell of chlorine.<br>
Thieving behavior is not uncommon among cats. They will often grab objects like stuffed animals, feather dusters, and other things that remind them of prey.<br>

A house cat could beat superstar runner Usain Bolt in the 200 meter dash.<br>
About half of the cats in the world respond to the scent of catnip.<br>
Cats can be toilet-trained.<br>
Cats can drink sea water in order to survive. (In case you’re wondering, we can’t.)<br>
Cats don’t have an incest taboo, so they may choose to mate with their brothers and sisters.<br>
Cats dream, just like people do.
Cats have contributed to the extinction of 33 different species.<br>
Cats were first brought to the Americas in colonial times to get rid of rodents<br>.
Collective nouns for adult cats include “clowder,” “clutter,” “glaring,” and “pounce.”<br>
Each cat’s nose print is unique, much like human fingerprints.<br>
