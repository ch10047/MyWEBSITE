  <h1> The Best animal,Cats! </h1> <br>
<h2> Did You Know</h2> <br>
  <p>  The “cat pattern,” established very early in the evolution of modern mammals, was a successful one: early cats were already typical in form at a time when the ancestors of most other modern mammalian types were scarcely recognizable.,br. They first appeared in the early Pliocene Epoch (5.3 to 3.6 million years ago), and they have continued with remarkably little change into modern times.   </p><br>
